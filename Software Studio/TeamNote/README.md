Credits: Used code that is based on examples shown in RailsCast episodes - especially to do with user authentication and creating associations

Bugs:

I can not get the link of the button I am mousing over in order to get the url to make an ajax call. $(this).attr('href') returns undefined. However, if I pass in a specific url, the ajax call works.

I have also tried making another ajax event, where by clicking the show preview button, a new window opens with the notes content. This only works for a few of the notes however.

Creating and editing permissions within the form for a note depends on knowing user_ids. Creating permissions on its own works with user names.

Time Spent:

~20 Hours
